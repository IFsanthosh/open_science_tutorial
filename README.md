Practical Tools to Pursue Open Science
======================================

This repository contains the source files for the tutorial given in [ICFO](http://icfo.eu/) on 4 June 2015.

Abstract
--------
Open science lowers barriers to access scientific work, fosters collaboration, and helps young researchers to build up reputation. While open science has many aspects, in this tutorial, we focus on sharing code and computational details in extensible and didactic forms, and on setting up an academic website. In particular, we will at the basics of open source development on GitHub along with establishing some good practices, then we will talk about literate programming and computational notebooks, and finally we show how to start a blog-aware, science-friendly website without costs or knowing web programming. While the tools to be discussed are language agnostic, we will use Python during the hands-on examples.
