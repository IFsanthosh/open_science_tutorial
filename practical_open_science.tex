%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{A Plethora of Options}
\begin{itemize}
\item For papers, the standard in this community is arXiv.
\begin{itemize}
  \item See self-archiving policies.
  \item Open access journals.
\end{itemize}
\item Social networking: \href{https://www.academia.edu/}{Academia.edu}, \href{https://www.researchgate.net/}{ResearchGate}
\item Sharing other outputs: \href{http://figshare.com/}{FigShare}, \href{https://github.com/}{GitHub}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{GitHub}
\begin{itemize}
\item Quick way to put things online: code, notebooks, figures, data, blog, website.

\item Ease of collaboration: other people can build on your work with low effort.

\item Stars, followers, forks: good work will attract attention.

\item Gaining features designed especially for researchers.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Citable code (DOI).
\end{itemize}

\item Became the de facto open source site.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Version Control Systems}
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not do damage to yourself: start using a version control system now.

\item Think of it as an annotated history of whatever you work on.

\item Avoid two common problems:
 \begin{itemize}
\item One million versions of some file you work on: {\scriptsize \verb+Untitled245version16_gl_edited_version5_with_comments2.docx+}

\item Limited undo.
\end{itemize}
\item What they are bad at: binary files and large files.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Workflow in Git}
\begin{itemize}
\item Git emerged as a new paradigm to VCS: distributed repositories.
 
\item You will probably use a total of five or six git commands.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Initialize a repository.
  \item Add files.
  \item Make commits.
  \item Check out earlier versions or other branches.
  \item Push to and pull from GitHub.
  \item Maybe synchronize with upstream.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Sharing and Collaborating}
\begin{itemize}
\item Literate programming: notebooks.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mix text, mathematical formulas, code, figures and data in the same context.
  \item It is outstanding for explaining ideas to others, it can serve as a computational appendix.
  \item It is not so good for development.
\end{itemize}
\item Code: how actual development is done. It helps others to continue your work.
\end{itemize}
