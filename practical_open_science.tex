\begin{frame}{GitHub}
\begin{itemize}
\item Quick way to put things online: code, notebooks, figures, data, blog, website.

\item Ease of collaboration: other people can build on your work with low effort.

\item Stars, followers, forks: good work will attract attention.

\item Gaining features designed especially for researchers.

\item Became the de facto open source site.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Version Control Systems}
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not do damage to yourself: start using a version control system now.

\item Think of it as an annotated history of whatever you work on.

\item Avoid two common problems:
 \begin{itemize}
\item One million versions of some file you work on: {\scriptsize \verb+Untitled245version16_gl_edited_version5_with_comments2.docx+}

\item Limited undo.
\end{itemize}
\item What they are bad at: binary files and large files.

\begin{frame}{Workflow in Git}
